This is my front page. I'm just starting to populate my blog. 
For now I wish to try also the mathjax plugin to show the math

$$\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\
\dot{y} & = \rho x - y - xz \\
\dot{z} & = -\beta z + xy
\end{aligned}$$

Right now, I am creating a personal blog for Engineering Mechanics Dynamics. If you're interested on my project, contribute on my [GitHub](https://github.com/johnanthonyjose/johnanthonyjose).
